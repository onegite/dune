Few movies of the post-pandemic era have elicited as much interest as Denis Villeneuve’s Dune, the oft-adapted science fiction classic that has yet to find its ideal expression on film. David Lynch’s 1983 version was an infamous bomb, though it has subsequently developed a cult following, while a well-regarded cable-TV adaptation was stymied by the limits of effects technology and their comparative budget.

Villeneuve, known for high-end science fiction films like The Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, promises to bring the right combination of visual grandeur and philosophical weight to the vaunted epic. Here’s everything you need to know about Dune before release.

What Is Dune About?
Frank Herbert’s original 1965 novel Dune was hailed as a watershed in science fiction, and today, it still stands as a genre classic. It depicts a stellar empire in the far future where space travel depends upon a rare spice found only on the desert planet of Arrakis, otherwise known as Dune. The first novel involves the political machinations of two noble houses for control of the planet — the Atreides and the corrupt Harkonnens — with the Atreides son and heir Paul emerging as a messiah to Arrakis’s natives. Herbert wrote five additional novels in the series, and there have been numerous additional works written by Herbert’s son Brian and Kevin J. Anderson

How Does Denis Villeneuve’s Dune Differ From Earlier Adaptations?
Villeneuve brings his own visual style and storytelling instincts to the story and reportedly addresses issues of representation in a modern manner that previous efforts didn’t. Beyond that, the biggest difference lies in the running time. Dune is actually the first part of a movie trilogy covering the events of the novel, which means this entry will likely end on a cliffhanger. In return, the longer running time allows for greater development of the story than the Lynch film, while the cinematic scale and higher budget provide the kind of visual spectacle that the cable miniseries lacked the resources for.

Where Can I Find Dune Online?
Although it may be easy to forget, Warner Bros. announced in December 2020 that every major film release in 2021 will premiere simultaneously in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service. There were significant questions earlier in the year about whether this would be adhered to or not, as Villeneuve publicly voiced fears that the film would able unable to recoup its investment via streaming. Nevertheless, Warner Bros. is holding to its original plans, which means that Dune will be available online on HBO Max for 30 days, launching the same day as the film’s theatrical release on Oct. 22.

According to Variety, Warner Bros. gave financier Legendary Entertainment the option to push Dune to a 2022 theater-exclusive release. However, after three delays, Villeneuve and others were opposed to any additional postponements.

Where Can I Order Tickets For Dune?
Tickets for Dune are not yet on sale but will be available at Fandang, as well as the official websites of theater chains like AMC, Regal Cinemas and Cinemark.

What Is The Critical Reception For Dune So Far?
Initial reviews have been largely glowing following the film’s premiere at the 2021 Venice Film Festival, and it holds an 86 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Empire Magazine referred to it as “awe-inspiring,” while the Los Angeles Times called it “an astonishingly vivid, sometimes plausibly unnerving vision of the future.” Other outlets, however, have been less kind. Time magazine cited its “sluggishness” despite being impressed with the film overall, and both Variety and The Hollywood Reporter discussed its slow pace and emotional coldness. Earlier adaptions suffered from similar complaints, which may be endemic of Herbert’s epic scope and fastidiously detailed world-building.

To see the new vision for a science-fiction classic,  Dune will be available in theaters and exclusively online on HBO Max on October 22.

How to stream Dune when it comes out
One of the most beloved science-fiction novels of all time is getting its third live-action adaptation, and it’s set to debut on HBO Max. Frank Herbert’s Dune—serialized in Analog magazine in the 1960s—is often mentioned in the same breath as Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, owing to its distinctive world and ambitious scope.

Though it’s been described as an “unfilmable” book over the years, visionary director David Lynch did his best with a 1984 feature starring Kyle MacLachlan, Sean Young, Patrick Stewart, Max von Sydow, José Ferrer, Brad Dourif, and Sting. A made-for-TV Dune miniseries also aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2000.

Now, Blade Runner 2049 filmmaker Denis Villeneuve is putting his own spin on the spacefaring epic, along with screenwriters Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and Eric Roth (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). The director has said he intends for it to be the first of at least two Dune movies.

Back in December, Warner Bros. announced that it would release its entire 2021 slate—including Godzilla vs. Kong, Dune, and The Matrix 4—on HBO Max.

Villeneuve’s film is scheduled for release on October 22, according to Variety. After premiering at the Venice Film Festival, Dune will hit theaters and HBO Max simultaneously.

In four words? “Out-of-this-world.” While we already summarized the first reactions out of Venice, Rotten Tomatoes has the film at an 88 percent fresh.

“Dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material,” reads the critics consensus, “but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation.” Folks are comparing the film to 2001: A Space Odyssey, saying “Sometimes you just know when you’ve seen an all-time great.” Apparently, Villeneuve’s Dune falls into that category.

Where can I watch Dune when it comes out?
Dune is one of the most anticipated movies of 2021. After its release was delayed by the pandemic, Dune is set to arrive on October 22, 2021. Here’s what you need to know about its release and how you can watch it.

Denis Villeneuve’s epic film will have a dual release in theaters and on HBO Max in accordance with Warner Bros.’ decision to launch all 2021 movies on the new streaming platform and in theaters at the same time. The move was controversial, with Villeneuve himself crying foul that his masterpiece is being released on the new streaming service rather than only in theaters, but in the end it might be a boon for viewers as COVID cases rise and the fear of variants and breakthrough cases keep people away from theaters.

Villeneuve has been very vocal about his opposition to Dune’s HBO Max release, comparing watching the movie on the small screen to driving a speedboat through in a bathtub. His comments, however well-intentioned, drew criticism and support from his peers, who pointed out that most people will never be able to see the “classics” on the big screen, so a movie should hold up on the small screen just as well as it does on the big.

That said, it’s unfortunate that a movie of Dune’s scope is being released in a time when many people aren’t able to go to theaters. As the Delta variant spreads, it’s anyone’s guess where we’ll be in October when the movie comes out. The silver lining is that it’s coming out at all.

How to watch Dune
Dune, director Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi classic, is finally coming out this year, at least if it doesn’t get delayed again.

There are a couple of different ways you can watch Dune, so we thought we’d run down what you need to know.

When does Dune come out?
Dune releases on October 22. You can go see it in theaters then. But that’s not the only place it’ll be available?

Can I watch Dune on streaming?
Late in 2020, Warner Bros. made the decision to release all of its 2021 movies in both theaters and on HBO Max at the same time. So you if you have HBO Max, you stream Dune on it at home come October 22.

What’s more, you can do it for no extra charge beyond the ordinary HBO Max subscription price. This is contract to Disney, which has released some movies simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+, but in those cases subscribers have to pay a $30 fee in addition to the base Disney+ subscription price.
